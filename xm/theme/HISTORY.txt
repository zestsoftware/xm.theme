History for xm.theme
====================

(name of developer listed in brackets)


xm.theme 0.8 (2008-09-16)
-------------------------

- Added locales/en to work around i18n bug: with e.g. Dutch and
  English as allowed languages, Dutch as site default, English as
  browser language (the only one or not), you would get Dutch for all
  translations in the xm.theme domain, even though the rest of the UI
  is in English... [maurits]

- Fixed the livesearch.js customization to work with Plone 3.1.x We have to drop
  support for Plone 3.0.x for this one, because jquery.js is not available.
