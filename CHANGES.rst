  permission now.  [maurits]

  English as allowed languages, Dutch as site default, English as
  browser language (the only one or not), you would get Dutch for all
  translations in the xm.theme domain, even though the rest of the UI
  is in English... [maurits]

  support for Plone 3.0.x for this one, because jquery.js is not available.
